    "## Introduction\n",
    "At UBC a computer science research team directed by Frank Wood is collecting data about how people play video games.The data is going to be used to train autoregressive diffusion models, in an attempt to create a model that learns continuously. They investigated this by creating a minecraft server to begin tracking and recording the movements and actions of players. To run this research they have to make sure they efficiently collect and record players to obtain enough data whilst still having enough resources to run the project, such as software licenses. To help with their research they are looking to see who subscribes to the newsletter as there are stakeholders that may want to know what demographic applies to the newsletter. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out who is most likely to subscribe, we are going to create a model that predicts if the player will **subscribe** to the playing newsletter depending on the **playing hours** and **age** of the players. To do this we will target and tidy data relevant to the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set used contains seven variables as a description of the player. This includes experience, subscribe, hashed email, played_hours, name, gender, age. The variables age and played_hours are numeric variables; subscribe is logical variable; and experience, name, and gender are are characters. The data will then be wrangled and organised clearly to be used in the model. The model will consist of a knn class prediction based upon the variables of playing hour and age of the players. Ultimately we aim to build a prediction model will produce data that will aid the UBC computer science research team in their research. "

This distribution is extremely skewed, since almost everyone played very few hours, while a small number of players logged very high values, even over 200 hours. This tells us that gaming habits vary a lot across the group. \n",

    "- The third plot compares age and played hours and colours the points based on whether the player subscribes or not. Since most players cluster within 0-10 played hours, the pattern between subscribers and non-subscribers are difficult to observe; but overall, most players with longer played hours subcsribed to the gaming newsletter."

Because the dataset is imbalanced, meaning there are significantly more subscribers than non-subscribers, the split is stratified by the subscription status to preserve the distribution of classes in both subsets. This ensures that the model sees a fair mix of both groups during training and testing, so it doesn’t accidentally learn to favour one over the other. To ensure the data split is reproducible across run and computers, we set a seed before performing the split."
